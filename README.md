Wikimedia being a large platform, is divided into the Wikidata and WikiCommons. WikiCommons has the charge of hosting audio files everything multimedia including pronounciation recording, which is sometimes not linked to corresponding wikidata thereby creating a gap where some wiki data lack audio pronounciations in languages.
