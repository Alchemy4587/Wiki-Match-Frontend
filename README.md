# Wiki-Match-Frontend

## Project Overview

**Wiki-Match-Frontend** is a user-friendly solution dessigned to faccilitate the contribution process on Wikimedia, focusing on linking audio pronounciation on WikiCommon to the corresponding Wikidata item. The problem we are addressing is the absence of audio pronounciation in a certian language or no audio pronouncitiation at all. Wiki-Match, with it's user friendly interface allows users to listen to audio pronunciations in a their specified choosen language and match them with the correct Wikidata items or entries.

## Problem Statement

Wikimedia being a large platform, is divided into the Wikidata and WikiCommons. WikiCommons has the charge of hosting audio files everything multimedia including pronounciation recording, which is sometimes not linked to corresponding wikidata thereby creating a gap where some wiki data lack audio pronounciations in languages.
